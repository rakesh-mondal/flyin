# Project Structure Guide

## Directory Structure

The Flyin app is organized as follows:

- **src/** - Main source code directory
  - **app/** - App-specific routes and configurations
  - **components/** - React components
    - **ui/** - Reusable UI components (shadcn)
    - **Booking/** - Booking-related components
    - **TripCuration/** - Trip curation components
    - **trip-detail/** - Trip detail components
  - **data/** - Mock and sample data
  - **hooks/** - Custom React hooks
  - **lib/** - Utility functions and libraries
  - **pages/** - Page components (e.g., [Search.tsx](mdc:src/pages/Search.tsx))
  - **styles/** - CSS and style-related files
  - **utils/** - Utility functions

## Key Files

- Entry point: [main.tsx](mdc:src/main.tsx)
- Main application: [App.tsx](mdc:src/App.tsx)
- Utility functions: [utils.ts](mdc:src/lib/utils.ts)

## Page Structure

Each page follows a similar pattern, as seen in [Search.tsx](mdc:src/pages/Search.tsx), acting as a container for components specific to that page's functionality.
