# Visual Preservation Mandate

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

**All technical enhancements MUST preserve the existing design, visuals, and layout of the application.** The current design is a key asset and must be maintained throughout all technical improvements.

## Implementation Guidelines

When modernizing the codebase:

1. **Pixel-Perfect Preservation** 
   - Maintain exact visual fidelity with current design
   - Use visual regression testing to verify no visual changes
   - Reference existing components for styling patterns

2. **Refactor Inside-Out**
   - Change internal implementation without affecting external appearance
   - Ensure color schemes, spacing, and animations remain identical
   - Maintain current responsive breakpoints

3. **Verification Process**
   - Take screenshots before and after changes to compare
   - Use Percy for automated visual regression testing
   - Verify changes across multiple viewport sizes

## Examples of Allowed vs. Disallowed Changes

✅ **Allowed**:
- Refactoring component internals
- Moving styles to more maintainable patterns
- Extracting business logic to services
- Adding type definitions

❌ **Disallowed**:
- Changing colors, spacing, or typography
- Modifying responsive behavior
- Changing animation timing
- Altering layout or component positioning

## Reference UI Components

Before modifying any component, refer to these key UI components to understand the current design language:

- [FlightSearchForm.tsx](mdc:src/components/FlightSearchForm.tsx)
- [TripDetail.tsx](mdc:src/components/TripDetail.tsx)
- [Navigation.tsx](mdc:src/components/Navigation.tsx)
