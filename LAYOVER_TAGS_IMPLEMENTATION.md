# Layover Tags Implementation Summary

## ✅ Successfully Implemented Layover Tags on Search Results Page

### **Features Added:**

1. **Layover Tag Display Logic:**
   - **Short Layover** (Red tag): Less than 2 hours
   - **Long Layover** (Orange tag): More than 4 hours  
   - **Normal Layover**: 2-4 hours (no tag shown)
   - **Direct Flights**: No layover tags

2. **Hover Tooltip Functionality:**
   - Shows exact layover duration on hover (e.g., "6h 30m in Dubai")
   - Clean and informative user experience

3. **Implementation Locations:**

#### **FlightResultCard Component:**
- ✅ Added `getLayoverTag()` utility function
- ✅ Added tooltip functionality with hover details
- ✅ Integrated layover tags into existing card layout
- ✅ **6 tests passing** - all functionality verified

#### **MainCuration Component (Search Results Page):**
- ✅ Added `getLayoverTagType()` utility function
- ✅ Updated both outbound and inbound flight sections
- ✅ Added tooltip providers and layover tag display
- ✅ Modified sample data to include various layover scenarios

### **Visual Design:**
- **Short Layover**: Red badge (`bg-red-50 text-red-700 border-red-200`)
- **Long Layover**: Orange badge (`bg-orange-50 text-orange-700 border-orange-200`)
- **Hover Tooltip**: Black background with white text showing full layover details

### **Sample Data Updated:**
- Added flights with different layover durations for testing:
  - `6h 30m in Doha` (Long Layover)
  - `1h 45m in Paris` (Short Layover)  
  - `5h 15m in Doha` (Long Layover)
  - `2h in Dubai` (Normal - no tag)

### **Testing:**
- ✅ All FlightResultCard tests passing (6/6)
- ✅ Tests cover all layover scenarios
- ✅ Tooltip functionality verified
- ✅ Edge cases handled properly

### **Files Modified:**
1. `src/components/TripCuration/FlightResultCard.tsx`
2. `src/components/TripCuration/MainCuration.tsx`
3. `src/data/sampleFlightData.ts`
4. `src/components/TripCuration/FlightResultCard.stories.tsx`
5. `src/components/TripCuration/__tests__/FlightResultCard.test.tsx`

### **Usage:**
The layover tags now automatically appear on:
- ✅ Search results page flight cards
- ✅ Individual flight result cards
- ✅ Both outbound and return flight sections

**Users can now quickly identify flights with problematic layover durations and see exact layover times by hovering over the tags.**

## ✅ **Recent Update: Tag Repositioning**

### **Improved Tag Placement:**
- **Before**: Layover tags appeared in the second row with airline information
- **After**: Layover tags now appear in the first row, right next to the time and "via DXB" text
- **Benefit**: More prominent visibility and better visual association with flight timing

### **Updated Visual Layout:**
```
[Time] [via DXB] [Layover Tag] ← First row (updated position)
[Airline] [Stops] [Seats Left]  ← Second row
```

This creates a more intuitive user experience where layover information appears directly adjacent to the flight time and routing information.
